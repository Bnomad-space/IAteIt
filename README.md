Easily share and connect with others about what you’ve eaten today. When you're pondering what to eat, take a peek at others’ delicious food photos for some inspiration. No need to worry about capturing picture-perfect shots. Your posts will disappear from others' view after 24 hours.

## Features
- Please only upload food photos. Only pictures taken in real time can be posted.
- Simply snap a photo, no need to add any additional information to create a post.
- Posts will be shared for 24 hours, after which only you can see them.
- You can communicate with others through comments.
- In a single post, you can add multiple photos using the 'Add a plate' button.
- All the food photos you've captured are visible on the profile screen.
- If you come across any non-food posts, please report them to us.
